# Downloads setup.sh + Brewfile and hands off to setup.sh. This exists so the
# Flipper payload is a single typed line instead of a timing-sensitive sequence.

# Run it with:

#
# Note the $(...) form rather than a pipe: it keeps stdin attached to the
# terminal so setup.sh can prompt for the admin password.

# Override the ref for branch testing:
#   SKYLINKS_SETUP_REF=feature/skylinks-admin-macbook-setup bash -c "$(curl ...)"

# (e.g. mac-setup-v1) before rolling this out to machines, and update the
# Flipper payload URL to the same tag in the same commit.
