# Skylinks Register Setup

Boring, stable setup workflow for location-level Skylinks **registers** (POS
terminals). The third flow alongside `../new_mac_scripts/` (admin MacBooks) and
`../new_win_scripts/` (admin Windows laptops).

## Philosophy

Simple and solid.

A register is a fixed, always-on point-of-sale machine — not a personal
laptop. This flow removes bloatware, provisions store WiFi, installs the POS
browser and support apps, and keeps the machine awake. It is not a kiosk
lockdown (no auto-login or assigned-access); that can be a later phase.

## What it installs

- Google Chrome (the web POS — Lightspeed — runs here)
- Slack (staff comms)
- PowerShell 7 (management shell)

The **Star receipt printer** driver is not on winget and is a checklist item
with the vendor URL. See `post-install-checklist.md`.

## What it configures

- **Always-on power**: display never turns off, machine never sleeps. This is
  the opposite of the admin-laptop flow, and correct for a register.
- Minimum telemetry; Cortana removed.
- Aggressive, reversible bloatware removal (Microsoft consumer apps, OEM junk,
  OneDrive).

## What it does NOT change

Security settings are **reported only**, never changed — BitLocker, Windows
Update behaviour, and the register name. In particular the script flags setting
**Windows Update active hours** so the register never reboots mid-business, but
leaves that to a human. See `post-install-checklist.md`.

## WiFi

The script prompts the operator for the store SSID + password at runtime and
provisions the profile so the register reconnects on its own. **No credentials
are stored in this repo.** The password is read as a SecureString, used only to
write a temporary profile that is deleted immediately, and never logged. Leave
the SSID blank to skip (wired registers).

## Setup method

Normal path is a Flipper Zero BadUSB payload that opens the Run dialog and
types a single self-elevating line. The operator stays with the register for
the whole run.

Without a Flipper, open an **elevated** PowerShell (right-click > Run as
administrator) and run:

```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skylinks-Golf/skylinks-scripts/main/src/local/new_pc_scripts/bootstrap.ps1)
```

`bootstrap.ps1` creates `%USERPROFILE%\Skylinks-Setup`, downloads `setup.ps1`
and `packages.txt` into it, and runs `setup.ps1`.

## Elevation

The Flipper payload runs, via the Run dialog:

```
powershell -Command "Start-Process powershell -Verb RunAs -ArgumentList '-NoExit','-Command','iex (irm <bootstrap-url>)'"
```

A normal PowerShell launches and immediately re-launches itself elevated,
triggering a **UAC prompt**. The operator clicks **Yes**. Because the elevated
window runs the bootstrap on its own, there is no keystroke timing tied to the
UAC dialog.

## Re-running

Safe to re-run. winget skips anything already installed; bloatware removal and
power settings are idempotent. WiFi can be skipped on re-runs.

## Pinning the ref

`bootstrap.ps1` fetches from `SKYLINKS_SETUP_REF`, which defaults to `main`.
Before rollout, cut an immutable tag and use it in both `bootstrap.ps1` and the
Flipper payload URL, in the same commit.

## Legacy

`legacy/` holds the earlier standalone scripts (`new_pc_setup.ps1`,
`remove_bloatware.ps1`) this flow was consolidated from. Kept for reference.
